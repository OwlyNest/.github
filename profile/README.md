## Declaration of existence

> By this stroke of... keyboard buttons; my insanity has become reality, and I have become the founder of the OwlyNest organization.
> ~ *Amity*

OwlyNest was born from curiosity, persistence, and a bit of well meant insanity. The kind it takes an operating system from scratch, to build a compiler for the sake of understanding compilers,
and to turn learning into creating.

OwlyNest is not a company, nor a product.
OwlyNest is a ***nest***. A place for ideas to grow and take flight. A community built on curiosity, passion (or call it obsession) and the belief that knowledge and learning should always remain open.

## Philosophy
- Openness: Code is meant to be read, studied, shared and understood.
- Integrity: Credit is important. Every file, every author, every contribution has a name.
- Curiosity: The best discoveries come from experiments that shouldn’t work, but do.
- Simplicity: Understand what you make, make what you don't understand

## What we make
OwlyNest has a growing ecosystem of projects; each one built to teach, inspire and challenge:
- [AmitX](https://github.com/OwlyNest/AmitX); A home made operating system helped by the comfort of GRUB
- [AmitGFX](https://github.com/OwlyNest/AmitGFX); Sooner or later the same as AmitX, but with a hand crafted bootloader
- [Owly](https://github.com/OwlyNest/Owly); Our very own Language! Named after Owly herself. Made in C, compiles to \<undecided\>
- [Ember](https://github.com/OwlyNest/Ember); The build tool that's coming to replace Make. Still needs a lot of work, but works plenty
- [Generators](https://github.com/OwlyNest/Generators); Tiny CL tools to generate formatted file templates, currently for C and Assembly.

## For builders, learners and the Brave
OwlyNest is there for those who look at the impossible and go: *"yeah, I can probably do that."*
It's for those who want to understand how things work, why things work, and how you can make it yourself.

You don't have to be an expert, just persistent, curious and perhaps a little bit insane in the right way.
